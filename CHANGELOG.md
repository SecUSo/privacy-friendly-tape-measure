Privacy Friendly Tape Measure can measure the size of objects in pictures based on objects of known sizes (e.g. coins) in the same picture. Just find a coin or other reference object of a known size, put it next to the item you want measured and take a picture. Make sure all objects are in the same level and the picture is taken perpendicularly to it. Now you can mark the reference object in the picture and measure any length or area you want!
 
The app can also display rulers or a protractor on the screen. Use this to quickly measure small objects or to cut a pizza in six equal slices. Yum!
 
This app belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. More information can be found at secuso.org/pfa/
