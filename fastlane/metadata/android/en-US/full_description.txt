Privacy Friendly Tape Measure can also display rulers or a protractor on the screen. Use this to quickly measure small objects or to cut a pizza in six equal slices. Yum!

What makes Privacy Friendly Tape Measure different from other similar apps?

1. Fewer permissions
Privacy Friendly Tape Measure uses only the Read External Storage permission. It needs it because most pictures on your phone are located on the SD-card as opposed to the internal phone memory.

2. No advertisement
Many other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle you with annoying advertisements which also shorten battery life.
